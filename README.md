Capsule Man is designed to be about a world of capsules as a civilization.
In Capsule Man, you will survive in a forest for 60 days, before being rescued.
Die and you restart.
Survive and you win.
But remember, everything will kill you if you don't play right. Bears, moose, skunks, porcupines, everything.
You must drink water, eat food, and create makeshift weapons.

BETA RELEASES WILL NOT BE COMPLETE, ESPECIALLY V1.0!! V1.0 HAS NO GAMEPLAY, IT IS MEANT TO SHOW WHERE EVERYTHING STARTED!!
The project is CLOSED SOURCE. My code is mine, you will respect that, otherwise it will be taken down.
